Event Handlers 
    Attach event handlers to components in React 
    Define React state 
    Learning how to use useState

DOM vs React 
    React event names are camelCase not lowercase 
        <button onClick={activateLasers}>
            ActivateLazers
        </button>

Event Attributes 
    Any event you can listen for in JS you can listen for in React 
        onClick
        onMouseOver
        onSubmit
        etc

React State 
    Core Concepts 
        Components 
            Building block of react 
            Combine logic and presentation 
        Props 
            Data that we can pass to components 
            Immutable
        State  
            Data specific to a component 
            Can Change 
What common things belong in state
    Showing or hiding something 
    Fetching data from an API 
    Themes color or styles that change based on an event 
    When working with some information, ask yourself if this needs to ________

State
    state is created using useState
    useState return an array with two values
        What the piece of state is 
        A function to change it 
            const [mood, setMood] = useState('happy');

Initial State 
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    function person() {
        const [mood, setMood] = useState('happy');

        return (
            <div> your mood is {mood}</div>
        );
    }

    We import useState from React 
    useState takes one argument, what you'd like the initial state to be 
    You must call useState IN the component 
    You CANNOT call useState in loops or conditionals 

    Changing State 
        We'll do this in our example using setMood
        Whatever we pass to this function will be the new value of mood 

        return (
            <div> your mood is {mood}</div>
                <button onClick={() => setMood('exited')}>Change</button>
            </div>
        )
